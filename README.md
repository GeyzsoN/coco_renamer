# This will rename the filenames of your images and will do it to the annotations too.
# IMPORTANT!
This will replace the original image names and the annotations.json so you need to actually duplicate the dataset. That is the most important part.

To use this go to your terminal and type:

```python

python3 renamer.py [draganddropyourimagepath/images/] [draganddropyourannotationfile/annotations.json]


```
